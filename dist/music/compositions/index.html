    <h1>Compositions</h1>
    <p>Since kindergarten, I have been composing music for the piano, organ, and other instruments. One of my favorite activities is to just sit at the piano and play, seeing what comes of it. I usually write through-composed pieces in a classical or jazz style, and I've written over a dozen finished pieces.</p>

    <h2>Recent Compositions</h2>
    <h3>For Lewiston | 10/25/23</h3>
    <p>"For Lewiston" is a piano piece written in honor of the victims of the mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine on October 25th. Our family camp is in the town next to the shootings, and everything around us was put on lockdown. School was canceled, so I spent the day at the piano composing, and I wrote this piece. It begins with a motif in F minor, where the melody emphasizes the 9th of the scale, which is repeated throughout the piece as it flows through sections of more thorough counterpoint, a sudden climax, and finally melancholic calm. It has since been awarded the XVII Golden Key Piano Composition Competition Award.</p>

    <h3>Fantasia in G Minor | 3/23</h3>
    <p>"Fantasia in G Minor" is a grand piece of through-composed organ music, starting with a section of forceful, complex harmony which gives way to a soft melody in A major. It continues through a number of key centers, tempos, and melodies—many of which focus on the minor 9th of the key—that eventually lead back to a climatic section paralleling the opening’s tonality and complex harmonic style. I performed this piece in the Kotzschmar Memorial Trust Music Scholarship competition.</p>

    <h3>Andante Cantabile | 1/24</h3>
    <p>“Andante Cantabile” is a piece of classically-styled counterpoint written for string quartet, opening with a theme in C minor repeated throughout the piece, as its motifs are developed through harmonic, structural, and melodic variations. This is the most advanced counterpoint I’ve ever written, with very intricate overlaps of melodies and motifs, especially in the ending which fits together almost every idea constructed over the course of the piece.</p>
