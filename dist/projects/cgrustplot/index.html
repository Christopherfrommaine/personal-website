      An ascii-art plotting library for Rust. Here's an animation of a function plot of a phase-shifting square wave fourier approximation:

    <p>
      It has many different plot types, including scatterplot, regionplot, densityplot, etc. Check out the README on GitHub for a full list with examples.

      For example, here is a binned array plot which shows a function similar to f(x, y) = sin(x * y):
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the other cool features is that the function plot automatically determines an "interesting" domain to plot it over. It will find points of interest on the function by using numerical techniques, and will try to fit a plot to match them. For example, here is the plot of a polynomial without having to input anything except the function itself:
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>entirety</em> of the code used to generate this image is as follows:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">
      use cgrustplot::plots::function_plot::function_plot;

      fn main() {
        // a cool-looking function
        let f = |x: f64| -x + 2. * x * x + x * x * x;

        // plot it, save it
        function_plot(&f)
            .set_size((200, 30))
            .as_image()
            .save("function_plot_demonstration.png");
      }
    </pre>

    <p>
      Even the animation at the top of the page was rendered entirely in rust using constructs from this library. Frames were created an exported with function_plot, and they were rendered with animation_plot (using a slightly hacky method to make it render arbitrary image files into an animation).
    </p>

    <h2> Purpose </h2>
    <p>
      It was originally written because I didn't know of any good plotting libraries for rust that were super simple and easy to use. I was doing projects around mathematical optimization, so I just wanted an easy plotting library to visualize current progress.

      It now has <span id="download-count"><em>[Error fetching download count from crates.io]</em></span> downloads on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cgrustplot">crates.io</a> and is being updated with new features every release.
