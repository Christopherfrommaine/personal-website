# Outline

## Resume
### Design
Very minimal, basic dark background and white text

### Content
Copy of my google docs resume:

Education

etc

## Research
### Design

### Content
WSRP Paper (Overview and integrated PDF document)
WELP summary and link

## Programming
### Design
Gravitational simulation in the background: black background and white balls, blurred. Big question: real-time sim or prerecorded? I think real time would work better.
Large title text: "Programming Projects" with room to scroll (as you start to scroll, all balls fall off screen)

### Content
Summary of skills:
Rust, Wolfram, Python, 

## Music
Also fairly basic design. Best compositions at the top, with performances or artistic notes (from MIT Music Portfolio).
Performances with integrated youtube player

Possibly seperate page with full list of compositions and autio files. Include github repo for compositions



# In Depth
## All Pages

### Header
Image logo (/dist/assets/logo.svg, or a png if you need it to be converted) linked to home page (christopherfrommaine.netlify.com/) in top left corner, constant-width padding to the upper left.

Within some width threshold, write out full menu justified to the right. Otherwise, dropdown hamburger menu:
- Resume
- Research
- Projects
- Music
These may also need to be sub drop downs? e.g. music into compositions vs performances

### Footer
Â© 2025 Christopher Gilbert. Links to github, youtube(s), and insta.

### Color Scheme
TBD for exact details. Mostly dark theme on blue? Neutral dark background (#121212), tinted dark background for gradients (see google drawings), highlight color (bright blue), white text color (pure white), subtext color (light gray).
